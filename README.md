# Local Subtitles for your own Broadcasts

Currently most programs available to add subtitles to your own broadcasts require sending your audio to a third-party service. This is a basic attempt at a fully local, livestream-native subtitling program.

## Plans

This is still in very early development so it's not really usable as-is. If you're really interested before I finish updating this, you can send me an [email](mailto:scrybe@synth.sh) and I can help you set it up.

Some features planned:

- Multiple audio streams. Meaning you can create independent subtitles for desktop audio and your microphone at the same time.
- Support for Twitch native closed captioning
- OBS plugin to support muting subtitles when you mute your microphone in OBS
- Support subtitle translation
