- move toggles to a collapsable
- add a new "real-time" slider that adjusts the step size
- add transcript to top bar if not on the main page
- add a mechanism for pushing updates, emit `x_update` event, and clients recreate state by calling `get_x`
- tune acceptance params https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/blob/master/include/whisper.h#L493-L499
- model manager
    - download models
    - download coreml models
- ship a test piece of audio to init the model after selecting it (specifically for coreml)
- automatically detect silence and trim it
- see how easy it is to detect speaking from an audio format perspective, or maybe even see how easy it is to isolate the voice
